Eddi: Emergent Dynamic Design Interface
=======================================

**Interactive environmental systems through movement**

.. note::
   This is an early-stage research project exploring performer-controlled, responsive environments.
   The system is currently undergoing modernization from the original PI3E/Lumi implementation.

Eddi is an experimental platform for creating interactive environmental systems that respond to human movement and gesture. Originally developed from Masters Thesis work at Georgia Tech on PI3E (Platform for Intelligent, Immersive, Interactive Environments), it explores the intersection of physical theater, computer vision, and environmental design.

Key Features
------------

* **Performer Empowerment**: Direct environmental control through movement
* **Gesture Segmentation**: Advanced techniques from thesis research  
* **Multi-Modal Output**: Lighting, sound, and other environmental controls
* **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency response for live performance
* **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based system for extensibility
