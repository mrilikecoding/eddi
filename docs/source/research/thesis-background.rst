Thesis Background: PI3E
=======================

Platform for Intelligent, Immersive, Interactive Environments

Academic Context
----------------

This work comes from Masters Thesis research at Georgia Tech, exploring how technology can empower performers to directly shape their environment through movement.

Research Questions
------------------

**Primary Question**
   How do we create technological systems that empower performers to directly sculpt their environment through movement?

**Secondary Questions**
   * How do we flatten the hierarchy between human expression and environmental response?
   * What gesture segmentation techniques can enable more nuanced movement recognition?
   * How can technology enhance rather than replace creative collaboration between performers and designers?

Artistic Foundation
------------------

Physical Theater Pedagogy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Teaching physical theater and directing ensemble work showed how powerful it is to give performers direct control over their environment. The most compelling work emerges when performers can shape space through embodied expression.

Traditional Hierarchies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional theatrical production separates designers and performers, leading to:

* Disjointed collaborations
* Lighting design independent of embodied exploration  
* Environmental control "from above" rather than through performance

Embodied Agency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Physical theater training emphasizes:

* Performers as spatial sculptors
* Environment as extension of body
* Direct relationship between intention and space

Technical Innovation
-------------------

Gesture Segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The thesis created new techniques for:

* Recognizing movement quality vs. just position
* Temporal segmentation of gesture sequences
* MEI/MHI (Motion Energy/History Imaging) processing
* Spatial awareness and multi-zone mapping

AI Director System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decision-making system inspired by:

* Psychological arousal research (El Nasr 2006)
* Adaptive learning from performer interaction
* Real-time response generation
* Environmental pattern coordination

Real-time Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical requirements for live performance:

* 30+ FPS processing capability
* <100ms input-to-output latency
* Robust hardware interface management
* Configurable spatial mapping

Theoretical Framework
--------------------

Embodied Cognition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system is grounded in embodied cognition research, recognizing that:

* Cognition is fundamentally embodied
* Environmental responsiveness affects behavior and awareness
* Technology can enhance embodied agency

Performance Studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drawing from performance studies understanding of:

* Technology's role in live, ephemeral practice
* Performer-environment collaboration
* Improvisation and real-time creation

Human-Computer Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Designing interfaces that:

* Feel collaborative rather than controlling
* Extend rather than replace human capacity
* Support artistic intuition

Implementation Results
---------------------

The PI3E/Lumi prototype demonstrated:

* Successful real-time gesture recognition
* Effective performer-environment interaction
* Novel applications in physical theater training
* Platform extensibility for multiple use cases

Future Directions
-----------------

The thesis established foundations for:

* StreamPoseML integration for modern pose estimation
* Multi-modal environmental control (sound, lighting, etc.)
* Plugin architectures for extensibility
* Educational applications in movement pedagogy

This research continues through the Eddi modernization project, translating theoretical insights into practical, extensible tools for performer empowerment.
