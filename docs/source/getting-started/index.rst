Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Eddi! This section will help you understand the project and get up and running quickly.

Overview
--------

Eddi (Emergent Dynamic Design Interface) is an experimental platform for creating interactive environmental systems that respond to human movement and gesture. It empowers performers to directly shape their environment through embodied expression.

Project Status
--------------

.. warning::
   Eddi is currently in early development, migrating from the original PI3E/Lumi implementation to a modern, extensible architecture.

What's Available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* âœ… Legacy Kinect-based lighting control system
* âœ… Basic gesture recognition pipeline  
* âœ… OSC/DMX communication for lighting control
* âœ… Modern Python project structure and CI/CD

What's In Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ðŸ”„ Core functionality migration to modern architecture
* ðŸ”„ StreamPoseML integration for camera-based pose estimation
* ðŸ”„ Plugin system for extensibility
* ðŸ”„ Web-based configuration interfaces
