Core Concepts
=============

Understanding Eddi's Philosophy
-------------------------------

Eddi (Emergent Dynamic Design Interface) is built on specific philosophical principles derived from physical theater practice and embodied cognition research.

Performer Empowerment
---------------------

**Traditional Model**: Environment controlled "from above"
   * Lighting operators control from booth
   * Designers make decisions separate from performance
   * Performers adapt to predetermined environmental design

**Eddi Model**: Performer as environmental sculptor
   * Movement directly shapes lighting, sound, space
   * Environment extends performer's expressive capacity
   * Real-time collaboration between body and space

Flattened Hierarchy
-------------------

Physical theater teaches us that the most compelling work emerges when traditional hierarchies dissolve:

* **Performer ↔ Environment**: Not performer *in* environment
* **Body ↔ Space**: Movement *becomes* environmental design
* **Intention ↔ Response**: Direct relationship, not mediated control

Embodied Agency
---------------

Drawing from somatic practices:

**Embodied Presence**
   The system responds to *how* you inhabit space, not just *where* you are

**Movement Quality**
   Recognizes the difference between reaching for something vs. pushing it away

**Spatial Intention**
   Understands directional focus and energetic projection

Emergent Response
-----------------

Rather than pre-programmed cues:

**Intelligent Adaptation**
   System learns and responds to performer patterns

**Contextual Awareness**
   Responses consider spatial, temporal, and energetic context

**Creative Collaboration**
   Technology amplifies rather than replaces artistic intuition

Technical Philosophy
--------------------

Real-time Responsiveness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<100ms latency ensures movement and response feel connected

Modular Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plugin system allows extension without system redesign

Multi-modal Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Originally lighting-focused, extensible to sound, projection, etc.

Use Cases
---------

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Physical Theater**: Direct environmental sculpting through movement
* **Dance**: Choreography that includes light and space as dance partners
* **Music**: Visual-spatial extension of musical expression

Education
~~~~~~~~~
* **Movement Pedagogy**: Students experience their spatial agency
* **Design Training**: Collaborative creation between performers and designers
* **Research**: Study human-environment interaction

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Responsive Environments**: Spaces that adapt to visitor presence
* **Community Interaction**: Collective environmental shaping
* **Meditative Spaces**: Environments supporting contemplative practice

Key Terminology
---------------

**Gesture Segmentation**
   Breaking continuous movement into meaningful units

**Spatial Mapping**
   Dividing performance space into responsive zones

**AI Director**
   System component that makes intelligent lighting decisions

**Environmental Sculpting**
   Direct shaping of space through movement

**Embodied Interface**
   Technology that responds to full-body expression rather than discrete controls
