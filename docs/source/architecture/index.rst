Overview
--------

Eddi's architecture is designed around performer empowerment and real-time environmental response. The system uses a modular, plugin-based approach to enable extensibility while maintaining low-latency performance requirements.

Key architectural principles:

* **Real-time Processing**: <100ms latency for live performance
* **Modular Design**: Plugin-based extensibility
* **Performer-Centric**: Direct environmental control through movement
* **Multi-Modal**: Support for lighting, sound, and other environmental outputs
